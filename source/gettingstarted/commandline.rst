Introduction to command-line
============================

In many steps regarding Python usage reference the "console", 
"terminal", "command window" or "command-line" -- these all mean
the same thing: a window on your computer where you can enter commands.
When you get to main tutorial, you'll learn more about command line.
For now main thing you need to know is how to open command window and
what it looks like:

.. rst-class:: html-toggle

Windows
-------

Depending on your version of Windows and your keyboard, one of the 
following should open a command window (you may have to experiment
a bit, but you don't have to try all these suggestions):

* Go to the Start Menu or Screen, and enter "Command Prompt" in search field.
* Go to Start Menu -> Windows System -> Command Prompt.
* Go to Start Menu -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt.
* Go to Start Screen, hover your mouse on lower-left corner of the screen,
  and click the down arrow that appears (on touch screen, instead flick
  up the bottom of the screen). The Apps page should now open. Click on
  Command Prompt in Windows System section.
* Hold down special Windows key on your keyboard and press the "X" key.
  Choose "Command Prompt" from the pop-up menu.
* Hold the Windows key and press the "R" key to get "Run" window. Type
  "cmd" in the box, and click the OK button.
